# IMPROVEMENTS


1. **Demand and Supply Dynamics**:
    - As you produce more remnants, their value could decrease (due to oversupply), pushing the player to move to the next phase or find ways to increase demand.
    - Occasionally, there might be "biological fairs" or "insect expos" which spike the demand, giving players a brief window to make extra money.

2. **Refinement Process**:
    - Introduce a refining or processing mechanic. Instead of selling raw remnants, players can process them into a more refined product, which fetches a higher price. For instance, processing remnants into a powder or extract.
  
3. **Consumers & Feedback**:
    - Introduce feedback from buyers. For instance, "Weirdoes" might request a specific type of insect remnants or provide feedback ("too decomposed!", "need rarer types!"), pushing players to adapt their collection or storage methods.

4. **Secondary Products**:
    - Derived products like insect exoskeleton jewelry or art pieces can be made and sold for higher prices but require more remnants and maybe additional resources.

5. **Preservation & Quality**:
    - Introduce a mechanic around maintaining the quality of remnants. Maybe certain storage options help keep remnants fresher for longer, fetching a higher price. Additionally, investing in preservation methods can reduce decomposition losses.

6. **Educational & Outreach Programs**:
    - Players can invest money into educational programs or documentaries that increase the popularity of insect remnants, creating a temporary spike in demand and price.

7. **Speculative Storage**:
    - Allow players to "store" remnants anticipating future price spikes, adding a speculative element to the game.

8. **Black Market & Smugglers**:
    - Introduce riskier selling options. Players can sell to smugglers or on the black market for higher prices, but there's a chance they could get caught, losing some remnants or facing fines.

9. **Insect Breeding**:
    - Instead of merely collecting remnants, allow players to breed certain insects, ensuring a continuous supply. This, however, requires maintaining breeding environments, introducing another layer of resource management.

10. **Hiring Assistants**:
    - Players can hire assistants for collection, processing, or selling. Different assistants come with unique abilities but also have their costs and may need training.

To ensure a tight loop:
1. **Ensure Collection, Consumption, and Sales are Balanced**: If remnants are collected too fast, and sales aren't keeping up, players might get bored. Similarly, if remnants decompose too quickly without proper storage, players might get frustrated. 
2. **Feedback Mechanism**: Always provide feedback to players so they know the impact of their decisions. If they invest in better storage, show them how decomposition rates have decreased. If they process remnants, show them how profits have increased.
3. **Escalation**: The costs and rewards should escalate with progression, pushing players always to seek upgrades and improvements.
4. **Random Events**: Introduce random events (like a sudden surge in demand, a competitor, a natural disaster, etc.) that can shake things up and provide moments of excitement or challenge.

Your game, as envisioned, offers a combination of strategic decisions, resource management, and progression. By tweaking and adding these elements, you can provide depth and replayability, ensuring players stay engaged throughout Phase 1 and are eager to jump into Phase 2.
