# Outbreak Orchestrator

![](img/cover.png)

Alternate name: Brain Root

In "Outbreak Orchestrator," players embark on a unique journey through the microscopic world, harnessing the power of fungi, parasites, and plants to manipulate and control a vast ecosystem. Starting with simple fungal spores, players evolve their abilities, collecting various biological materials like Rodent Remnants, Feather Fragments, and Insect Integuments. As they progress, they delve deeper into the world of mind-controlling organisms, unlocking the potential to influence larger creatures and even human behavior.

The game blends elements of strategy and clicker mechanics, requiring players to invest time in research, boost their knowledge levels, and automate collections. Through their endeavors, players can influence and take over pharmaceutical companies, animal organizations, and even world governments, all while balancing the need to appease these entities. Monetization plays a role as players use funds for storage, equipment, influence, and keeping their operations covert.

Achievement is marked by unlocking new collectables, automating systems, inventing mind-controlling mechanisms, upgrading research capabilities, and expanding their influence from Earth to the universe. The overarching goal is not just to observe but to orchestrate a grand biological outbreak, determining the fate of entire species and civilizations.


# REQUIREMENT  

- I want a game like Universal Paperclips
- Should be easy to build, html and javascript

**Remember**, the key to a successful clicker game is the **sense of progression**, so ensuring players feel rewarded and can upgrade or evolve their fungi will be essential!

# JOBS

Fully draw out all the boxes for shrooms, parasites, plants and viruses


# CHOSEN THEME 

## MECHANISM

	- COLLECT insects and PARASITES:   MUSHROOMS:  PLANTS:  VIRUSES
	- SELL, TRADE, DISPOSE
	- INVEST STUDY TIME: Assign % research time 
    - INFLUENCE ANIMALS/BEINGS: mutant controlling shroom/parasite/mechanism
    - Animal species automated to do your bidding
    - Improve control/influence over species
	- Upgrade research level
	- NEW COLLECTABLE STREAM
	- repeat


## Unlockables

- New Collectable Item
- Automate collection
- Collection Rate
- Study Allocation efficiency level up
- Research level Up
- Stealth Level UP  

- Appease/influence/Take over:
	- Big pharma
	- Animals organisations
	- Stock Market
	- Governments
	- Alien civilizations



# Sequence of Events

1. Game Intro: story about your job
2. A single button you tap to collect your first fungal item or insect item
3. Sell what you can to low tier buyers
4. ....



- Collect insect stuff
- invest time to study them
- unlocks ability to control animals/things to automate collecting faster: research level ++
- A certain threshold of collected items + research level opens up more parasite/insect material to collect which expands available things to control and influence
- eventually could have 5 to 10 different kinds of clicker boxes for the different collectables

mushroom opened up 

- collect mushroom stuff
- invest time to study them 
- unlocks ability to control animals things to automate collecting faster: research level ++
- A certain threshold of collected items + research level opens up more mushroom/fungi stuff to collect

- Possibly later expand to plants with the same mechanisms as above.
- at this point, the player has three different types, collecting multiple items within that type.  the cheaper, less valuable stuff gets automated more quickly so that feels like an achievement when you see those coming in and being collected.
- Eventually this builds up to taking over pharamaceutical companies, animal companies, then the market  then the world, then the unvierse!

- Advanced clicker tasks
- Mutant army Designer
- A increase/decreaste button to adjust % of fungi army, parasite army, plant army, another for exploration rate, infection rate, worker production, collector production etc. 


## Things to add:

- Virus creator 
MONEY 
- Sell to weirdoes, then drug makers/criminals, then universities, big pharma
- money for storage hold
- money to help buy support items
- money to pay off police and keep your activities hidden
- money for other things. 
- so the itmes above needs to be monopolised some how 

## Achivements & Progression mechanism example

- Add new collectable thing i.e. fungal fragment
- Collection automator
- Invention! Simple rodent controller 
- Research level upgrade
- Time invested efficiency upgrade
- Influence: Big pharma, Animal orgs, Stock Market, Government, Global Public
- Take over: All those above
- Appease: all those above (maybe first stage)

## Future

- COOPT UNI STUDENTS
	- PROPAGANDA: "INCREASE FUNGAL RIGHTS"
	- THEN CONSUME THEM 
	- PSYOPS IT
- WORLD BATTLE MAP
	- Take France, Take Belgium, Take Vietnam
- ALLIANCES
	- LEAVE SMALL GROUPS OF HUMANS ALONE
- SYMBIOSIS
	- TREAT CERTAIN GROUPS AS NEUTRAL
- HUMANS PUSH BACK
	- They create vaccines
	- you need to unlock counters


What's missing:

- clarity around money (or other similar thing to get support items, influence)
- Maybe some computer related stuff to get control over global IT systems?
- Other? Suggestions?

# GENERAL THEME 

Possibly needs sorting 

**1. Early Game Mechanics - Insects and Parasites:**
   
   - **Starting Point**: You're a budding scientist studying parasites. You collect basic materials like Rodent Remnants, Feather Fragments, and Insect Integuments.
   
   - **Selling & Money**: Early on, these are sold to universities and labs for research. This gives you funds.
   
   - **Automation**: As you progress, you can create basic parasite traps, breeding habitats, and deploy controlled animals to fetch these materials for you.
   
   - **Research Points (RP)**: With every new specimen, you gain research points. These are critical for unlocking new levels, abilities, and automation tools.
   
   - **First Major Breakthrough**: Your research allows you to unlock basic control over rodents.

**2. Intermediate Game Mechanics - Mushrooms and Fungi:**

   - **Unlocking Fungi Studies**: After reaching a particular RP threshold, fungi become available.
   
   - **Fungi Collection**: Start with basic mushrooms like Spore Sacks. As your RP increases, unlock new and exotic fungi.
   
   - **Advanced Automation**: Use fungi to create spore traps and bio-reactors. This helps to amplify your collection rate.
   
   - **Fungal Control Over Animals**: With more advanced fungi, control larger animals, each with unique collection rates and abilities.

**3. Advanced Game Mechanics - Plants & Global Influence:**

   - **Plant Control**: After sufficient RP, tap into plant networks. They can be used to harvest resources, influence areas, or produce advanced compounds.
   
   - **Global Influence and Monetization**: Start by monopolizing the pharmaceutical market with revolutionary drugs. Control over animal organizations allows for advanced experimentation without ethical boundaries. Stock market control gives immense funds, while government control aids in avoiding legal repercussions.
   
   - **Global Infrastructure Control**: With sufficient funds, you can invest in tech companies. This opens the door for cybernetic enhancements, digital surveillance, and control over global IT systems. Here's where the computer element can come in.

**4. End Game and World Domination:**

   - **Create Hybrid Entities**: Use your vast resources to invent mutants. These entities combine the strengths of parasites, fungi, and plants.
   
   - **Global Takeover**: Use your hybrids to influence global leaders, public opinion, and institutions. Eventually, manipulate the masses and control their will.
   
   - **Galactic Exploration**: Use your vast wealth to invest in space exploration. Seed other planets with your creations and expand your domain.

**Additional Mechanics and Ideas:**

   - **Stealth & Subterfuge**: With increasing influence and power, there's also increased attention. Allocate funds to pay off police, lobby governments, and influence media to keep your activities hidden.

   - **Challenges & Threats**: Face challenges from rival scientists, ethical committees, global coalitions, etc. Counteract them with your resources, mutants, or influence.

   - **Economic Mechanism**: Introduce supply-demand mechanics. As you monopolize markets, the prices of goods, research, and influences can fluctuate.

   - **Support Items & Upgrades**: Use funds to purchase advanced labs, hire other scientists for collaborations, buy out companies for resources, or invest in R&D for faster progression.

   - **Random Events**: To keep gameplay engaging, introduce random events. These can range from natural disasters affecting your resources to breakthroughs doubling your RPs.

Your game has the potential for complexity, intrigue, and a lot of strategic depth, similar to Universal Paperclips but in a biological domain. Remember to have periodic check-ins with the player to keep them engaged and provide constant challenges and rewards.
