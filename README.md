![](img/cover.png)

In "Outbreak Orchestrator," players navigate a microscopic world, using fungi, parasites, and plants to control an ecosystem. From starting with fungal spores to manipulating larger creatures and human behavior, players enhance their abilities by collecting biological materials and delving into the realm of mind-controlling organisms. The gameplay combines strategy and clicker elements, allowing players to research, automate collections, and even influence global organizations, all while managing monetization aspects. Success is marked by system automation, innovations in mind control, and expanding one's domain, aiming to orchestrate a grand biological outbreak that decides the destiny of species and civilizations.







# REQUIREMENT  

- I want a game like Universal Paperclips
- Should be easy to build, html and javascript
- Alternate name: Brain Root
- **NOTE TO SELF**: Pace yourself, step by step, no rush. 
- **Remember**, the key to a successful clicker game is the **sense of progression**, so ensuring players feel rewarded and can upgrade or evolve their fungi will be essential!



# JOBS

Fully draw out all the boxes for shrooms, parasites, plants and viruses

## NOTES

Add in plot, you need to collect high volumes to deeply understand them.


# CHOSEN THEME 

## MECHANISM

	- COLLECT insects and PARASITES:   MUSHROOMS:  PLANTS:  VIRUSES
	- SELL, TRADE, DISPOSE
	- AMOUNT TO STUDY THRESHOLD MET
	- INVEST STUDY TIME: Assign % research time 
    - INFLUENCE ANIMALS/BEINGS: mutant controlling shroom/parasite/mechanism
    - Animal species automated to do your bidding
    - Improve control/influence over species
	- Upgrade research level
	- NEW COLLECTABLE STREAM
	- repeat


# FULL DESIGN

1. Game Intro: story about your job


Sequence of Events

PHASE 1: Dabbling with Biology

1. Collect Insect remnants (various ants)
2. Study threshold met at 100 clicks - you can now research your collected matter. 
Choose % of effort to study this matter. 
3. Research Initial investigation unlocked. This fills up like a bar. 
4. CONSUMPTION: Collected matter ticks down from losses due to being discarded after study.
5. Research deep insight unlocked - This fills up like a bar. Upgrade=everyclick multiplied by 2
6. Research zombify unlocked This fills up like a bar
7. Zombie Ants unlocked! Automate CORPSE harvesting/collection once research complete - press to automate. 
8. Collected matter ticks down from losses due to decomposition
9. You can begin selling matter to people and Universities
10. Money to buy more research equipment (unlock them)
12. Money can buy you better storage options (increasing your max)
11. Equipment unlocks new abilities to study (i.e. increased automation efficiency, reduce decomposition loss, new abilities - they can collect resources for you etc.)

FINALLY Once a certain threshold met, you unlock the ability to collect a different biological resource i.e. next one is rodant remnance. This moves to Phase 2

UNLOCKS FOR PHASE 1

- Automation
- Improved Automation 
- Collection multiplier
- New Buyers: First you can only sell to weirdoes, then drug addicts, then University students, then universities, then Big Pharma and so on. For Phase one, only will be Weirdoes.  
- Once Phase 2 is unlocked, you can maybe trade or convert your Insect remnants for rodant remnants at a price/rate of 0.25 to 1 ..still thinking aabout this. 










PHASE: MUTANT ARMY

- Decrease & Increase button Like von neuman drone design
- Explore, speed, Infection rate, Mutation Rate, Matter gathering.
- Collonise towns, cities, countries... 
- NEWS UPDATE: The Mutant Horde has taken Greece (+10000 domination)

2. A single button you tap to collect your first fungal item or insect item
3. Sell what you can to low tier buyers
4. ....



- Collect insect stuff
- invest time to study them
- unlocks ability to control animals/things to automate collecting faster: research level ++
- A certain threshold of collected items + research level opens up more parasite/insect material to collect which expands available things to control and influence
- eventually could have 5 to 10 different kinds of clicker boxes for the different collectables

- MUSHROOM, PLANT, VIRUS REPEAT

- at this point, the player has three different types, collecting multiple items within that type.  the cheaper, less valuable stuff gets automated more quickly so that feels like an achievement when you see those coming in and being collected.
- Eventually this builds up to taking over pharamaceutical companies, animal companies, then the market  then the world, then the unvierse!

- Advanced clicker tasks
- Mutant army Designer
- A increase/decreaste button to adjust % of fungi army, parasite army, plant army, another for exploration rate, infection rate, worker production, collector production etc. 



## Things to add:

- Virus creator 
MONEY 
- Sell to weirdoes, then drug makers/criminals, then universities, big pharma
- money for storage hold
- money to help buy support items
- money to pay off police and keep your activities hidden
- money for other things. 
- so the itmes above needs to be monopolised some how 


## FEATURES TO UNLOCK

- New Collectable Matter
- Automate collection
- Collection Rate
- Study Allocation efficiency level up
- Research level Up
- Stealth Level UP  

- Appease/influence/Take over:
	- Big pharma
	- Animals organisations
	- Stock Market
	- Governments
	- Alien civilizations

- Events
	- FUNGUY! A new rockband to gain global support


## Achivements & Progression mechanism example

- Add new collectable thing i.e. fungal fragment
- Collection automator
- Invention! Simple rodent controller 
- Research level upgrade
- Time invested efficiency upgrade
- Influence: Big pharma, Animal orgs, Stock Market, Government, Global Public
- Take over: All those above
- Appease: all those above (maybe first stage)

## Future


- COOPT UNI STUDENTS
	- PROPAGANDA: "INCREASE FUNGAL RIGHTS"
	- THEN CONSUME THEM 
	- PSYOPS IT
- WORLD BATTLE MAP
	- Take France, Take Belgium, Take Vietnam
- ALLIANCES
	- LEAVE SMALL GROUPS OF HUMANS ALONE
- SYMBIOSIS
	- TREAT CERTAIN GROUPS AS NEUTRAL
- HUMANS PUSH BACK
	- They create vaccines
	- you need to unlock counters


What's missing:

- clarity around money (or other similar thing to get support items, influence)
- Maybe some computer related stuff to get control over global IT systems?
- Other? Suggestions?
